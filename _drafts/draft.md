Before anything else, let's see what is out there -- what organizations on GitHub are relevant to working on Ethereum?

I know that [@ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum) is the main entry point. But I have more questions:s

- **How is this different from the Ethereum Foundation?**
- **And where are the EIPs?** Well, that seemed easy. They're pinned on @ethereum. So, they're at [ethereum/EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).
