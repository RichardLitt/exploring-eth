James got back to me on Gitter! He agreed that Issue and PR templates might be useful. He made a basic stab at it by pulling content out of the wiki, but encouraged another PR on top of his work to help.

So, I've opened [this PR](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/pull/629), which does that. I cleaned up the issue template a bit, and the PR template.

I also took a screenshot of the Wiki tab on GitHub, added an arrow using Preview, and put the screenshot in the README.

It looks a bit silly, but sometimes people don't know that the Wiki tab exists. This should help. Me or [@simonv3](https://github.com/simonv3) did the same thing for [the Awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md), and I think it works fairly well as a guide for newcomers to GitHub. Never assume the UI works, either.
