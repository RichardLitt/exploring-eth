Hello ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to my no-frills blog for exploring the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm [Richard Littauer](https://burntfen.com) - a coder, designer, writer, and general all-around internet person. Over the next few months, I am going to be taking a look at the [@ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum) organization on GitHub and exploring how they document their different code bases, what processes they have in place to make this easier, and what I can do to improve their onboarding process. I'm also going to take the time to learn more about Ethereum, in general!

In lieu of long medium posts that take weeks to pen, I am going to be microblogging here. I'm planning to pen more expansive posts every now and then, and to create some dApps using Solidity, as I mess around and learn what a new coder can do easily on the Eth blockchain. Feel free to follow along.

If at any point you think I've made a mistake or been unclear, please **get in touch**. I won't learn nearly as much if I am just shouting into the void.

This work has been supported by [the Ethereum Foundation's hackternship grants](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/05/02/announcing-may-2018-cohort-ef-grants/). While I am significantly in starting this, I'm looking forward to exploring more over the next few months.

If you have comments, well wishes, or ideas, send me an email: richard@burntfen.com.
