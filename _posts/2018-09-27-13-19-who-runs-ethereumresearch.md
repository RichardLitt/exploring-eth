What is going on with [ethereum/research](https://github.com/ethereum/research)?

There is no README; or, more accurately, there _is_ a README, but it was set up on [July 8th, 2014 with no content](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/README.md). Vitalik set it up, which means he was probably focusing on what was important - actual research. However, after four years, there's not been an overhaul of this repository, it looks like, and it's not clear what it is for or how to use it for newcomers. 

You can tell this more easily by looking at the state of the active pull requests. There are [33 of them](https://github.com/ethereum/research/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc), with some which have been opened for a year. I have one which has been open since mid-August, which adds a [License and a README](https://github.com/ethereum/research/pull/92). It resolves two open issues; one from last december asking for a [README](https://github.com/ethereum/research/issues/73), and also the first issue, which was [a question](https://github.com/ethereum/research/issues/1) from [@wanderer](https://github.com/wanderer) asking what this repository is for.

But no one has looked at the PR since, that I can tell. Let's see if I can track down some people to figure this out. Since there's no README, I need to go elsewhere to look for help with this - it doesn't look like opening more issues or PRs here will solve the lack of response. Looking at [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), the first issue pinned in the organization view, there's a link to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/nthXNEv).

Thinking a bit more, I'm not sure go-ethereum is the right place to ask this. I'm going to ask Ken, who is moderating the Ethereum Grantees. He said he'd ask around.

For now, there's a few things I could do - either go through all of the issues and PRs and give feedback as if I was a maintainer, or not. I'm going to go with not, at the moment, because I think that it would be better to get someone who wants to maintain it first, otherwise I'm just adding noise.

I guess the lesson here is: when in doubt about maintenance, ask someone from inside the project. This is how I became a maintainer for a few of the lists I maintain, like [git-flight-rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) and [awesome-remote-job](https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job).
